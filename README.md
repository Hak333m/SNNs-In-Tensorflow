# Spiking Neural Networks in Tensorflow
> A guide on how to implement **Spiking Neural Networks** in Tensorflow. 

Tensorflow does not natively support SNNs, which means using core tf methods and API to implement them.

## Hodgkin-Huxley Model

For the actual implementation, a Biophysical model (i.e., a Hodgkin-Huxley model) is used, based on:  Izhikevich, *Eugene M. Dynamical systems in neuroscience : the geometry of excitability and bursting.* Cambridge, Mass. London: MIT Press, 2010, Chapter 8.

## Running

After cloning the repository, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the dependencies.  

## Upcoming work

Work is currently underway to demonstrate the application of an SNN to a classification task.
